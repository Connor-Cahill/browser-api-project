This was for an assignment for my Front End Web class. For this project I showed off some of the capabilities of CSS Flex box.

Flex box is a CSS rule that when an element's display is set to flex it becomes a flex-container, making all the child elements flex-items. This allows you to easily layout the child elements and adjust spacing.

In this example I demonstrated 2 key flex-box rules:
- Justify-content
- Flex-direction

Justify-content allows for you to easily modify the spacing of flex-items while flex-direction lets you quickly change which direction your flex-items are going.
